# MrClippy

A simple, experimental app for storing, editing and loading clipboard content.

The app is under heavy development to define its initial shape. At this point I don't care that much for UI until all the essential features are in place.

Initially the app is developed on Windows. [Mac](https://github.com/mlewand/mrclippy/issues/21) and [Linux](https://github.com/mlewand/mrclippy/issues/20) support will follow shortly after.

Contributions are welcome.

## Requirements

* nodejs

Dev version (Windows):

* `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` - ran as Administrator

## Running the app

Currently the only way to run it is to use dev version.

```
git clone https://github.com/mlewand/mrclippy.git mrclippy
cd mrclippy
npm install
npm run start
```
